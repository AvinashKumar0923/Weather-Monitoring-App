# Real-Time Data Processing System

## Introduction

This project implements a Real-Time Data Processing System for weather monitoring using the OpenWeatherMap API. The system retrieves weather data, processes it, and provides real-time updates along with alerts based on user-defined thresholds.

## Features

- **Real-Time Data Retrieval:** Fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- **Temperature Conversion:** Converts temperature values from Kelvin to Celsius.
- **Daily Summaries:** Calculates and displays daily weather summaries.
- **Alerts:** Triggers alerts based on configurable weather thresholds.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The HTML file containing the structure of the web app.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the web app.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file containing the logic for data retrieval, processing, and alerts.

## Setup and Usage

1. Clone the repository:

    ```sh
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd real-time-data-processing
    ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.

3. Use the web interface to:
    - Fetch real-time weather data.
    - View processed weather data and summaries.
    - Receive alerts based on user-defined thresholds.

## Example

### Fetch Weather Data

1. Click the "Fetch Weather Data" button.
2. The weather data for the specified city will be retrieved and displayed.

### Real-Time Data Processing

- The temperature values will be converted from Kelvin to Celsius.
- Daily summaries, including temperature and weather conditions, will be calculated and displayed.

### Alerts

- Alerts will be triggered based on user-defined thresholds (e.g., temperature exceeding a certain value).
